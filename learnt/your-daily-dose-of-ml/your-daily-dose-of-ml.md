### Google AI: [Revisiting Mask-Head Architectures for Novel Class Instance Segmentation](http://ai.googleblog.com/2021/09/revisiting-mask-head-architectures-for.html)

**Keywords**: instance segmentation; partially supervised instance segmentation

**Summary**: **Instance segmentation** is an important task to many downstream applications. Collecting large labeled instance segmentation dataset is time consuming. **Partially supervised instance segmentation** target to tackle the challenge but requires a **stronger form of model generalization** to handle **novel classes not seen at training time**. This paper proposed two easy-to-implement fixes (one **training protocol fix**, one **mask-head architecture fix**) based on Mask R-CNN like network that work in tandem to close the gap to fully supervised performance. ***While neither of these ingredients have a large impact on the classes for which masks are available during training, employing both leads to significant improvement on novel classes for which masks are not available during training.*** In a nutshell, **cropping exclusively to ground true boxes during training** and **using deep hourglass mask heads with 50 or more layers** brought significant performance improvement to unseen classes.

**Comment**: I haven't read the paper yet. I hope there will be more discussion about why these two fix would bring better performance to unseen classes. Otherwise it's just a technical report.
